# LB Get Folder Files
This extension allows you scan a folder to retrieve all the file names, optionally filter the file types and save them into a stack and .ini file. Very useful if you need to iterate through a lot files with different names and file types. 

Important Note: This extension uses a batch file to get all file names. After downloading and unpacking the .zip file, please make sure your antivirus did not delete the file and check its contents by right clicking on the file and selecting edit. 

Setup:
1. Place the whole folder `Get_Folder_Files` in your `LioranBoard/Ext` folder (create the Ext folder if it doesn't exist yet).
2. Install the extension in your LioranBoard while connected to Transmitter.
3. Edit the premade button in your Get Folder Files deck. 
4. Press the button.
5. Your files names will be saved in the .ini file you specified in your LioranBoard folder.

**How to install an extension:**
1. Download the .lbe extension file from **Releases** section (please do not right click and save) 
2. Click on Install Extension in your LioranBoard Receiver
3. Select the extension file you downloaded 
4. Select your default Transmitter you are using. Make 100% sure it is the correct one. 
5. Your Transmitter should automatically refresh. 
6. Most extensions include a premade deck with buttons. If you do not see one, create a new button, add "Send to Extensions" command and select the extension you just installed. If you can only see the extension name with no input fields, it means it was not installed correctly. Repeat steps above.
