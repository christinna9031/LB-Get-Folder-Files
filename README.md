# LB Get Folder Files
This extension allows you scan a folder to retrieve all the file names, optionally filter the file types and save them into a stack and .ini file. Very useful if you need to iterate through a lot files with different names and file types. 

Important Note: This extension uses a batch file to get all file names. After downloading and unpacking the .zip file, please make sure your antivirus did not delete the file and check its contents by right clicking on the file and selecting edit. 

Setup:
1. Place the whole folder `Get_Folder_Files` in your `LioranBoard/Ext` folder (create the Ext folder if it doesn't exist yet).
2. Install the extension in your LioranBoard while connected to Transmitter.
3. Edit the premade button in your Get Folder Files deck. 
4. Press the button.
5. Your files names will be saved in the .ini file you specified in your LioranBoard folder.
